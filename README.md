## My Repositories

- [Snake Game](https://github.com/Stipecim/SnakeGame)
  - > This project holds a special place as one of my earliest ventures into C++, albeit left unfinished. Despite its incomplete state, it served as a significant learning experience,          particularly in exploring the ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture. Through this endeavor, I gained a deeper understanding of C++ fundamentals and honed my skills in                software design.

- [Web-Scrap](https://github.com/Stipecim/Web-Scrap)
  - > A recent project of mine, Web-Scrap aims to become an independent app while also serving as a component in my upcoming Node.js project. It's a simple endeavor, reflecting my              journey as a newbie developer.

- [Makreter](https://github.com/Stipecim/Marketer)
  - > Marketer is my latest project, designed to be hosted from a PC. It features a RESTful API server with SQLite database integration. Additionally, it includes a mobile app built with       React Native that retrieves data from the server. The server performs data scraping and serves information to the mobile app.

- [Restful-ApiPractice](https://github.com/Stipecim/Restful-ApiPractice)
  - > Restful-ApiPractice represents my recent tutorial journey into building RESTful APIsâ€”a stepping stone in my path to becoming a Full Stack Developer. Through this project, I've            delved into concepts like controllers, middleware, validations, and more.
- [CppAcumullated knowledge](https://github.com/Stipecim/CPPAccumulatedKnowledge)
  - > CppAccumulatedKnowledge is a collection of text files representing my understanding of various topics in C++. It's a testament to my ongoing journey with one of my favorite       
      languages, albeit one that demands time and dedication to master. Despite its lesser popularity today, C++ remains close to my heart.

- [ECSHybrid](https://github.com/Stipecim/ECSHybrid)
  -  > ECSHybrid was born during my learning journey with the Entity Component System (ECS). It served as a pivotal moment where I unraveled the inner workings of ECS, gaining invaluable        insights into its functionality and applications.
